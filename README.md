# Secure-LP-match

Secure car License Plate (LP) matching
Homomorphic encryption schemes are used to securely match a license plate number to a database of license plate numbers.

lp_image_string.py: The license plate number is extracted from the image and converted to an integer.
testPaillier.cpp and testGentry.cpp are two implementations of secure matching using Paillier encryption scheme and Gentry scheme respectively.

(This repo does not have the code of header files.)
